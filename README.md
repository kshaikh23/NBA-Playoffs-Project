# The Play of the Playoffs
We set out to find how NBA play changes in the playoffs. At the same time, we wanted to come up with an algorithm that can predict how a player will play in the playoffs based on their play in the regular season.

After scraping and cleaning data for basketball-reference.com using the pandas library:

We ran multiple t-tests on different team statistics, comparing them in the regular and postseason, in order to determine whether or not there is a statistically significant difference with these stats in these situations. We found that **there is not a statistically significant difference in Free-Throw %, 3-Point Attempt rate, Turnover %, and Defensive Rebound %. In the playoffs, Pace of play, True Shooting %, 3-Point %, Assist %, Offensive Rebound %, and Offensive Rating all decrease while Free Throw Attempt rate and Defensive Rating increase.** These difference are visualized in a catplot which you can see in the code.

We used linear regression to predict points per game for players in the playoffs based on regular season stats. The stats that we used to predict playoff points per game included regular season points per game, assists per game, total rebounds per game, true shooting percentage, and player efficiency rating. Additionally, we made sure to create a correlation heat map between different statistics. This heatmap helped us identify which stats would be best used as features to predict points as the two stats would be correlated. Initially, we just used points in the regular season to predict points in the playoffs. However, we applied the info from the correlation visualization to create a model that should be accurate. When we tried varying the features that we used for prediction to the 5 stats most correlated with points, according to the correlation heatmap, we got a model that still wasn’t as accurate as we liked. However, we found that the additions of assists per game, total rebounds per game, true shooting percentage, and player efficiency rating made a more accurate model, other stats that were correlated with points, made the most accurate predictions.

The R2 value for the initial model that just used regular season points per game as a predictor for postseason points per game had an R2 value of 0.695 and a Mean Squared Error of 13.468. The second model had an R2 value 0.695 and Mean Squared Error 13.479. **The most improved model had an R2 value of 0.711 and a Mean Squared Error of 12.760.**
